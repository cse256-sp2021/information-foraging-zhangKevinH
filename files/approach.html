      <h3><a name="philo">Our Philosophy</a></h3>
      <p>
        Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to individual needs, serving as
        catalysts to spark each child’s interests and desire to experiment and explore. Our school
        provides a safe, nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all
        developmental areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play. Our
        approach is “hands-on,” where children act upon what they are learning and feeling. We
        consider the process more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for
        children to interact with their environment in ways that are meaningful to them. For each
        class, teachers develop a curriculum that reflects the interests and abilities of the children in
        the classroom. In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in science, art,
        music and Spanish. As trends in the field of early education change, we evaluate what is new
        and determine if it would be enriching for our program.

      <h3><a name="vision">Vision Statement</a></h3>
      <p>Washington University Nursery School:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Values children for their wonder and curiosity, their ideas and creativity, and their
          delight in play.</li>
        <li>Values families for their traditions and goals, their commitment to home, work, play,
          community, and their dreams for their children.</li>
        <li>Values teachers for their vision, their job in children’s play and achievements, their
          flexibility and skill, and their commitment and compassion. We support and respect
          what we learn from each other.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><a name="orient">Orientation</a></h3>
      <p>
        This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the child and parent(s) an
        opportunity to visit the classroom and meet the teachers and classmates. This visit is one
        hour. It will allow time for the child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a brief
        overview of what to expect during the school year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own (either Wednesday or Thursday, see
        orientation schedule). The class is divided in half, attending on either Wednesday or
        Thursday. This schedule allows the children and teachers to interact with a small group
        before the entire class attends on Friday.
      </p>
      <h3><a name="PScomm">Parent-Staff Communication</a></h3>
      <p>
        Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website and emails
        give you information on current themes, activities and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or
        emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child’s adjustment, observations and/or
        concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email
        or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.        
      </p>
      <h3><a name="Assessment">Assessment and Parent-Teacher Conferences</a></h3>
      <p>
        Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play,
        conversations and observations both in the classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers
        keep notes on each child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their
        development. Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples of the children’s
        writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activities
        in their program to enhance needed skills for children.
      </p>
      <p>
        The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an
        informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. The spring conference includes a
        more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any
        time during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.
      </p>
      <h3><a name="Cult">Our Multicultural Community</a></h3>
      <p>
        Guided by the teachings of educational theorists including Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries,
        and others, we create a learning environment that addresses the developmental needs of the
        whole child by using the wonderful resource of our diverse, multi-cultural population to highlight
        the similarities and differences between individuals, families, and cultures,
        celebrating the unique environment that is Washington University Nursery School.
      </p>
      <h3><a name="Discipline">Discipline</a></h3>
      <p>The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and nurturing environment
        for each child. Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers
        to spend as much time as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our
        rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends safe, and the toys at school
        safe.</p>
      <p>The staff is trained to anticipate potentially problematic situations; they remind children of
        appropriate behavior and redirect or intervene when necessary. In most cases, teachers can
        stop or re-direct behavior before something negative occurs. If not, teachers will first consult
        the injured party to make sure they are emotionally and physically okay. Then, they will turn
        their attention to the child who might need more support in “keeping their friends safe” or,
        more likely, “keeping their bodies safe” with others. Reflection over what has occurred will
        lead to discovering other behavior options and resolving things with the peer.</p>
      <p>Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline policy. Our aim is to have the
        children manage their own actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children
        learn and develop skills that they need to display appropriate behavior. This is done
        through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Positive reinforcement.</li>
        <li>Anticipating unhealthy social interaction.</li>
        <li>Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially positive activities.</li>
        <li>Naming and validating child’s feelings</li>
        <li>Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and constructive manner.</li>
        <li>Simple, logical and immediate consequences.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When inappropriate behavior is a continuing problem, the school will work with parents to
        understand the issue and make appropriate recommendations. It is our goal to make school
        a positive, rewarding and enjoyable experience for each child. We realize, however, that we
        cannot meet the needs of all children and parents. If it is determined that a child is not
        growing from his/her preschool experience at the Nursery School, a discussion will be held
        with parents at which it may be decided that this program is not appropriate for the child.
        The director and teachers will make recommendations of other preschool programs and
        relevant community services if parents so desire.</p>
